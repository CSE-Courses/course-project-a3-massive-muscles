The short head of the bicep is the inside part that is closer to your torso, and the long head parallel to the short head on the outside of your arm. Hammer Curls are a great exercise because it trains your long head, which is typically the more neglected part of your bicep. This exercise also pushes your tricep and bicep further apart which makes your arms look much bigger! This one exercise will change how your bicep AND tricep looks.");

The pectoralis minor is a small, thin muscle located below the pectoralis major; it is connected to the ribs and functions to stabilize a large bone on the shoulder (scapula). The pectoralis fascia is another thin, small muscle that is located on top of the pectoralis major and it wraps around your chest to connect to your latissimus dorsi. These three parts are all important in their own way, but the pectoralis major is the biggest and thus usually targeted the most when training. Because of how large and dense the chest muscles are as a whole, you can surprisingly train this muscle group much more than you'd think. With that in mind, do make sure not to go overboard and over train yourself into an injury!");
